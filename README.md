Abstract: Fake news could spread misinformation, influence
decision-making (such as voting), and use emotional extreme
statements to sway opinions. Therefore, tools that could be used to
decipher legitimate news articles from fake opinionated pieces are
critical. In this project, we developed a fake vs. true news detector
by applying two different machine learning algorithms - CNN
and RNN. We compared the results, and found that the CNN
model showed better results of accuracy and loss from training
and testing, as well as confirmation with K-fold validation.
